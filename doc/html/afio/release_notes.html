      Make boost/afio/afio_v1.hpp. Add BOOST_AFIO_LATEST_NAMESPACE. v1 namespace

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
          AFIO v1.4 will abstract out all the OS specific code into a C (not C++)
          abstraction layer. This makes it far easier to reuse the same code for
          a later AFIO based Filesystem TS implementation. It also eliminates the
          use of C++ exceptions at the OS specific layer. Note I may still use lambdas
          in the C abstraction layer, if compiled as C these appear as C callbacks
          but if compiled as C++ they are some callable type.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          The v1.4 engine will be rewritten yet again to use a new custom future
          implementation whereby async_io_op shall become afio::future&lt;T&gt;.
          This should let the API no longer return two sets of futures when returning
          results (async_io_op therefore matches afio::future&lt;void&gt;), plus
          make best use of the proposed concurrent_unordered_map by finally actually
          processing batches of operations as a batch, instead of one at a time.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          It is hoped that the v1.4 engine will have two additional bindings, one
          for Microsoft COM thanks to John Bandela's CppComponents (https://github.com/jbandela/cppcomponents)
          and another with plain C bindings (which actually wrap the COM object).
          Both these bindings have no requirement for anything Microsoft, and work
          as expected on POSIX.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          The v1.4 engine afio::future&lt;T&gt; ought to transparently support Boost.Fiber,
          this should let you program against AFIO using awaitable resumable functions
          which is much cleaner. The v1.3 engine already reduced latency by 50% over
          the v1.2 engine, but with Fibers we finally ought to eliminate the O(waiters)
          scaling for op completions in favour of O(1) to waiters.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          The v1.4 engine will finally make use of the API support for alternative
          async_io_dispatcher implementations, adding at least one for temp file
          support with special temp file semantics, and maybe others with transparent
          hashing and bit flip healing (see below). The temp file support will allow
          anonymous and named temp files which can be device volume matched to some
          path, thus allowing file move to be done without copying. Anonymous temp
          files can use Linux specific facilities for those.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Finally, making good use of the new coroutine support the v1.4 engine should
          have an async fast batch hash engine which provides transparent hashing
          of all async reads and writes with optional SECDEC ECC calculation. Hashes
          will probably be initially limited to Blake2b (crypto strong and very fast,
          even on ARM) and SpookyHash (not crypto strong, but superbly fast and for
          small blocks), though I may dust off my 4-SHA SSE2/NEON SHA256 engine for
          Intel and ARM for the giggle. In addition to fast batch hashing, the coroutine
          support should make filing system tree algorithms enormously easier to
          write, so expect an optimally fast race free directory tree visitor, deleter,
          mover and copier which is the find in files tutorial made generic.

<p>
      AFIO is now a Boost.BindLib based library. This has resulted in an enormous
      change set which is only barely summarised here:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
          AFIO is now capable of:
          <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle">
<li class="listitem">
                Being used standalone, or as a Boost module, or if you have inline
                namespace support in your compiler then both simultaneously in the
                same translation unit or in the same binary, including any combination
                of the following library dependency configurations (config macro
                and its default is shown):
              </li>
<li class="listitem">
                Using Boost.Atomic, Boost.Chrono and Boost.Thread OR the C++ 11 STL
                (BOOST_AFIO_USE_BOOST_THREAD=0).
              </li>
<li class="listitem">
                Using Boost.Filesystem OR the C++ 1z Filesystem TS (BOOST_AFIO_USE_BOOST_FILESYSTEM=1,

            That makes eight different potential configurations, and all eight can
            coexist in the same translation unit, though you will find compilation
            time becomes enormous.
          </p>
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          AFIO's unit test suite no longer requires Boost.Test, and can now alternatively

        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Dropped support for these compiler versions due to insufficient C++ 11

          symlink() now can create file symbolic links on Windows (it'll probably
          error out due to lack of privileges held by the user, but it can now at
          least try).
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added the TemporaryFile and DeleteOnClose file_flags. These improve lock
          file performance on Windows by about 60%.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added sparse file support. AFIO now always creates sparse file where possible,
          and converts any files it opens for writing into a sparse file where possible.
          You can disable that behaviour using the NoSparse flag.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          stat_t now contains member flags indicating if a file entry is sparse and/or
          compressed.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added a new api zero() which can very efficiently zero ranges in a file
          by deallocating them on physical storage (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">hole punching</span>&#8221;</span>).
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added a new api extents() which lets you query which ranges in a file contain
          valid data.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added a new api statfs() which returns a statfs_t which lets you query
          the volume on which a file or directory lives. Again, thanks to using the
          NT kernel API directly the structure on Windows is almost as complete as
          on POSIX.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Improved unit testing, especially unit testing of error handling, and indeed
          found that on Windows an invalid handle object generated by a failed open
          or an explicit close caused the next dependant operation to segfault. Also
          on Windows any errors generated during read() and write() were being lost
          and the dispatcher hanged instead of being reported (oops!).
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added an extra section to the tutorial on how to implement an atomic log
          file using the new features in AFIO.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Completely rewrote the async_data_op_req metaprogramming which assembles
          ASIO scatter gather buffers from types and containers supplied to read()
          and write(). The old system which had to work on VS2010 was basically a
          set of repetitive hardcoded template specialisation overloads for void
          *, T *, std::array, std::vector and std::basic_string. The new much more
          sophisticated metaprogramming (with an unfortunate corresponding increase
          in compilation times) now understands any STL like container (detected
          using SFINAE std::begin() and std::end()), including nested STL like containers,
          and will correctly generate ASIO scatter gather buffers from say something
          like a std::list&lt;std::list&lt;std::string&gt;&gt; but also correctly
          coalesce buffers for trivial types such as std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;trivial
          type, N&gt;&gt; where it spots that only one ASIO scatter gather buffer
          is needed. Const types were supported before in that only an asio::const_buffer
          could be constructed from the limited list of supported input types, but
          now the metaprogramming asks STL like containers if their values are const
          (e.g. unordered_set), and if so it will always generate an asio::const_buffer,
          which of course means that such STL like containers can only be used for
          writing only and not reading.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Fixed memory corruption in async_file_io_dispatcher destructor which only
          occurred when there were extant ops during destruction.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Use rename to random name before deletion pattern in rmfile() to work around
          Windows refusing new file creation with the same name as a recently deleted
          file. enumerate() now filters out such zombied pending delete files automatically.
          This makes AFIO rmfile() work on Windows with POSIX semantics.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Fixed bug where direntry() was using lstat() instead of fstat() on POSIX
          and therefore failing if the file handle had been deleted.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          symlink() no longer opens target file on POSIX, and instead returns a closed
          handle. The previous behaviour was throwing exceptions when the symlink
          was broken.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Made async_io_handle::path() virtual and now capable of asking for the
          current path of the file handle even after the file has been renamed or
          deleted. Doing this required a refactoring of the error generation code
          which previously consumed a const filesystem::path &amp;, now it consumes
          a lambda which generates the path on demand.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          File handles now refresh their path() to their true path on open, and again
          at various points during execution. A careful audit was undertaken to spot
          all instances where a fresh path is really needed versus a stale path,
          nevertheless some instances may have been missed. Nevertheless, this now
          means that AFIO can work with files whose names and locations change throughout
          the time that AFIO holds a path open to them, though note that inevitably
          this support will be racy if the filename changes between AFIO's refresh
          and the operation.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Replaced all use of filesystem::path with afio::path which on Windows enforces
          NT kernel path naming and ensures that multiple conversions from win32
          path to NT paths are no longer done. Support is also now provided for converting
          the NT kernel paths AFIO uses to traditional DOS ones.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          directory_entry::name() is now a string instead of a path.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Thanks to Travis CI adding Mac OS X as a CI target, added OS X support
          to AFIO. This involved writing an expect-based lldb automator to get stack
          backtraces of failures, which was tedious.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added APIs random_fill() and random_string() useful for generating crypto
          strong random file names.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          page_size() has become page_sizes(), and now can return large/huge page
          sizes. A file_buffer_default_size() new API will return the closest page
          size to 1Mb.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added file_buffer_allocator, a STL allocator suitable for allocating efficient
          large file buffers.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          stat_t flags, gen and birthtime weren't being set on FreeBSD. Sorry.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Made big changes to how async_path_op_req works and is used. Instead of
          hard coded overloads, async_path_op_req now takes a template parameter
          for the path and has metaprogramming for converting that into an afio::path.
          You can also now supply absolute and relative-to-the-precondition paths
          via <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">async_path_op_req</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">absolute</span></code> and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">async_path_op_req</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">relative</span></code>,
          plus you can supply a bare precondition which finally allows rmfile() et
          al to directly delete inputs by op handle. Also added a depends() API which
          lets you return one op handle only when another op handle completes.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Made AFIO provide <span class="bold"><strong>much</strong></span> stronger filing
          system race condition protection. This comes with a performance cost, so
          a new file_flags::NoRaceProtection can disable the new semantics. Renamed
          file_flags::FastDirectoryEnumeration to file_flags::HoldParentOpen as enabling
          HoldParentOpen will make most of the performance cost of race protection
          disappear.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Implemented WillBeSequentiallyAccessed and WillBeRandomlyAccessed for POSIX.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added is_open() to async_io_handle. Made pseudo deleted file filtering
          optional in enumerate().

<li class="listitem">
          Stack backtraces are now retained per exception throw as well as per op
          schedule if BOOST_AFIO_OP_STACKBACKTRACEDEPTH is defined (defaults to yes
          if NDEBUG is not defined). Also added MSVC and FreeBSD support, and exceptions
          returned by the future handle now provide stack backtraces.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Added virtual member functions link(), unlink() and atomic_relink() to

      Finished getting a ThreadSanitizer (tsan) + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (ubsan)

      Reorganised source code structure to fit modular Boost. AFIO is now a Boost
      v1.56 module just like any other. Obviously this will break source code compatibility
      with all preceding Boosts.

      Fixed a bug in the custom unit testing framework which was throwing away any
      exceptions being thrown by the tests (thanks to Paul Kirth for finding this
      and reporting it). Fixing this bug revealed that enumerate() with a glob on
      Windows has never worked properly and the exception thrown by MSVC's checked
      iterators was hiding the problem, so fixed that bug too.
    </p>
<p>
      Added async_io_dispatcher_base::post_op_filter() and async_io_dispatcher_base::post_readwrite_filter(),
      including documentation examples and integrating filters into the unit testing.
      post_readwrite_filter() ought to be particularly useful to those seeking deep
      ASIO integration. Thanks to Bjorn Reese for the long discussions leading up
      to this choice of improved ASIO support.

      During updating the benchmarks below now I have regained access to my developer
      workstation, discovered a severe performance regression in the v1.2 engine
      of around 27% over the v1.1 engine. Steps taken:
    </p>
<p>
      1. The shared state in every async_io_op was a shared_ptr, now it is the underlying
      shared_future. Eliminated copies of shared_ptr, now we always use the shared_future
      in enqueued_task directly. This reduced regression to 18%.
    </p>
<p>
      2. Removed more code from inside the TSX locks. This reduced regression to
      16%.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Removed the second TSX lock from complete_async_op(). This eliminated the
      regression and actually added 2% to the v1.1 engine.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Removed the second TSX lock from chain_async_op(). This added a further
      10% over the v1.1 engine, so we are now 12% faster which is about right given
      the v1.2 engine removed 15% of code.
    </p>
<p>
      Added nested TSX transaction support.
    </p>
<p>
      The CI shows that clang 3.1 now produces segfaulting binaries with this release,
      so rather than debug clang, I simply dropped clang 3.1 support. AFIO now requires
      clang 3.2 or better.

      This is a major refactor of AFIO's core op dispatch engine to trim it down
      by about 15%. Key breaking differences from the v1.1 series of AFIO are as
      follows:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
          Replaced all use of packaged_task with enqueued_task, a custom implementation

          thread_source::enqueue() now can take a preprepared enqueued_task.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          thread_source::enqueue() now always returns a shared_future instead of

        </li>
<li class="listitem">

            This substantially improves performance, simplifies the implementation,
            and lets completion handlers more readily retrieve the error state of
            preceding operations and react appropriately.

      Fixed failure to auto-const an async_data_op_req&lt;boost::asio::mutable_buffer&gt;
      when used for writing. Thanks to Bjorn Reese for reporting this.

      Replaced use of std::runtime_error with std::invalid_argument where that makes
      sense. Thanks to Bjorn Reese for reporting this.

      Replaced throwing of std::ios_base::failure with std::system_error. Thanks

      async_io_dispatcher_base::enumerate() did not take a metadata_flags, and it

      Added a unit compilation test to ensure that implicit construction from a single

      Significantly optimised build system and added in precompiled headers support.
      Combined with --fast-build this provides an 8x build time improvement.

      boost::afio::stat_t::st_type() is now a boost::filesystem::file_type instead

      Immediate completions no longer hold the opslock, which meant the opslock could
      be changed from a recursive mutex to a spinlock. The new, more parallelised,
      behaviour illuminated a number of new race conditions in when_all() which have
      been fixed.
    </p>
<p>
      Completely gutted dispatch engine and replaced with a new, almost entirely
      wait free implementation based on throwing atomics at the problem. If it weren't
      for the spin lock around the central ops hash table, AFIO would now be an entirely
      wait free design.
    </p>
<p>
      In order to do something about that spin lock, replaced all locking in AFIO
      (apart from the directory file handle cache) with memory transactions instead.
      This does CPUID at runtime and will use Intel's TSX-NI memory transaction implementation
      if available, if not it falls back to a spin lock based emulation. On memory
      transaction capable CPUs, AFIO is now almost entirely wait free, apart from
      when it has to fetch memory from the kernel.
    </p>
<p>
      Made AFIO usable as headers only.
